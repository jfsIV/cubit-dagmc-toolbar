## Toolbar Installation:
  - Clone this repository or download the tarball and unpack in the directory of your choice
  - Run the ./setup.sh script. This ensures paths in the resulting dagmc_toolbar.ttb file are resolved correctly by Cubit.
  - There should now be a `dagmc_toolbar.ttb` file in the toolbars directory.
  - Add the toolbar using the custom toolbar editor in Cubit.

  **Note: If the toolbar content is relocated on your system, the `setup.sh` script should be re-run and the toolbar re-imported in Cubit.**
