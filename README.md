## Toolbar Installation:
  1. Clone this repository or download the tarball and unpack in the directory of your choice
  2. Run the `setup.sh` script. This ensures paths in the resulting `dagmc_toolbar.ttb` file are resolved correctly by Cubit.
  3. There should now be a `dagmc_toolbar.ttb` file in the toolbars directory.
  4. Add the toolbar using the custom toolbar editor in Cubit as shown in the animation below:

  **Note: If the toolbar content is relocated on your system, the `setup.sh` script should be re-run and the toolbar re-imported in Cubit.**
